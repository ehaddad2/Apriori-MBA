Intro:

Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a method of data mining used in various ‘recommender’ systems. These systems contain algorithms that determine patterns in users' purchasing/browsing activity, which MBA uses to recommend products and services as effectively and accurately as possible. One of the most common algorithms associated with market basket analysis is the Apriori algorithm, which gathers a very large set of association rules (which are essentially “if-then” statements) in order to create a more efficient market, resulting in more sales. However, a crucial aspect of creating a successful market basket analysis is to distinguish ‘interesting’ association rules from the ‘uninteresting’ and potentially misleading ones.
